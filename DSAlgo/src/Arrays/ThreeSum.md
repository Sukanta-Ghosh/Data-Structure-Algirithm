Pseudo-code for the given code:

1. Create a function threeSumClosest that takes a vector A of integers and an integer B as input and returns an integer.
2. Create a vector num and initialize it with the values of A.
3. Sort the vector num in ascending order.
4. Initialize two variables: bestSum as 1000000000 and sum as 0.
5. Iterate over the vector num starting from the first element and ending at the second-to-last element.
6. Inside the loop, initialize two pointers: ptr1 as i + 1 and ptr2 as the last index of num.
7. While ptr1 is less than ptr2, do the following:

   - Calculate the sum of the elements at indices i, ptr1, and ptr2: sum = num[i] + num[ptr1] + num[ptr2].
   - If the absolute difference between target and sum is less than the absolute difference between target and bestSum, update bestSum to be equal to sum.
   - If sum is greater than target, decrement ptr2.
   - Otherwise, increment ptr1.

8. Return bestSum as the result.
