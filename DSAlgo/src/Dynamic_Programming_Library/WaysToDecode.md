### Explanation:

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

Let's define dp[i] as the number of ways to decode the string s[:i] (i.e. the first i characters of the string).

Now let's consider the two possible cases:

The i-th character is decoded as a single digit. In this case, the i-th character must be a non-zero digit. Therefore, dp[i] is equal to dp[i-1] if s[i] is not zero, and it is equal to zero otherwise.
The i-th character is decoded as part of a pair with the (i-1)-th character. In this case, the (i-1)-th and i-th characters must form a valid two-digit number between 10 and 26. Therefore, dp[i] is equal to dp[i-2] if the (i-1)-th and i-th characters form a valid two-digit number, and it is equal to zero otherwise.
The final answer is given by dp[n], where n is the length of the string s.

The base cases are dp[0] = 1 (the empty string can be decoded in one way) and dp[1] = 1 if s[0] is not zero, and dp[1] = 0 otherwise.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n). However, since we only need to keep track of the last two values of dp, we can further optimize the space complexity to O(1) by using two variables instead of an array.

### Further Explanation:

Let's take the input string "1234". We want to find the number of ways to decode this string.

We start by initializing dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1 (since the first character '1' can be decoded in one way).

Now let's consider the second character '2':

- If we decode '2' as a single digit, there is only one way to do so (i.e. 'B').
- If we decode '2' as part of a pair with '1', we get the two-digit number '12', which can be decoded in one way (i.e. 'AB').

Therefore, dp[2] = 2 (since there are two ways to decode the first two characters).

Now let's consider the third character '3':

- If we decode '3' as a single digit, there is only one way to do so (i.e. 'C').
- If we decode '3' as part of a pair with '2', we get the two-digit number '23', which can be decoded in one way (i.e. 'W').
  Therefore, dp[3] = 2 (since there are two ways to decode the first three characters).

Finally, let's consider the fourth character '4':

- If we decode '4' as a single digit, there is only one way to do so (i.e. 'D').
- If we decode '4' as part of a pair with '3', we get the two-digit number '34', which can be decoded in one way (i.e. 'CD').
  Therefore, dp[4] = 2 (since there are two ways to decode the entire string).

The final answer is dp[4] = 2.
